# ELLseg-Dataset：Epicardial Adipose Tissue, Left Atrium, and Left Atrial Appendage Image Segmentation Dataset (EAT & LA & LAA Dataset)


**Note:**
This dataset is continuously updated to include additional images and task types. It will be made publicly available once the paper is accepted.


## Overview
Accurate computing, modeling, and analysis of cardiac substructures such as epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), the left atrium (LA), and the left atrial appendage (LAA) are critical for advancing clinical applications, particularly in understanding and managing atrial fibrillation (AFib). Despite their clinical significance, segmenting these structures from CT images remains challenging and relies heavily on manual labor, which is time-consuming and error-prone.


The dataset provides CT cardiac images acquired in real clinical settings, focusing on EAT and LAA segmentation. It aims to create an open resource for researchers to test and validate methods for automated segmentation of these structures, particularly addressing the technical challenges of CT-based analysis.

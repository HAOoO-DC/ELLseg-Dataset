# Epicardial Adipose Tissue and Left Atrial Appendage Image Segmentation Dataset (EAT & LAA Dataset)

**Note:**
This dataset is continuously being updated, including the number of images and types of tasks. The dataset will be made publicly available after the paper is accepted.


## Overview
Accurate computing, modeling, and analysis of cardiac substructures such as epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and the left atrial appendage (LAA) are critical for advancing clinical applications, particularly in understanding and managing atrial fibrillation (AFib). Despite their clinical significance, segmentation of these structures from CT images remain challenging and rely heavily on manual labor, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

The dataset provides 40 CT cardiac images acquired in real clinical settings, focusing on EAT and LAA segmentation. It aims to create an open resource for researchers to test and validate methods for automated segmentation of these structures, particularly addressing the technical challenges of CT-based analysis.
